The project relates to four areas of operating systems: drivers, hardware, synchronization, and distributed processing. 

With the development of this project, a prototype of a robotic finger will be implemented, which must have its respective device driver and all the required software layers to allow interaction between the hardware and OS through it. Techniques for integrating hardware and software through the device driver will be developed and reinforced, and the necessary communication process from the operating system to the computer hardware will be detailed to ensure proper interaction.
